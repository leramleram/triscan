triscan
=======

This is a software for 3d scanning.

The goal is 3d scanning objects using a webcam, an arduino connected to a stepper motor, and one or two line-lasers. 
For now there are 3 scanmodes: 

 -Single leftlaser-scan
 -Single rightlaser-scan
 -dualmode scan where both scans are merged in one file and points are coloured regarding to the laser they belong to.
 
Maybe colour scanning will be possible in the future.

Buildstage is very alpha yet, be warned!!

Installation:

->Install python(x,y) from http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads
->Copy the sketchfolder somewhere on your computer
->Upload the arduino part
->Start the main.py file from the sketchbookfolder



Inspired by the tutorial of cube000.
