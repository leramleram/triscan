Software for 3d scanning with a webcam, an arduino connected to a stepper, and one or two lasers.

The goal is a software for 3d scanning objects with the use of a webcam, an arduino connected to a stepper motor, and one or two line-lasers. 
For now there are 3 scanmodes: 
 -Single leftlaser-scan
 -Single rightlaser-scan
 -dualmode scan where both scans are merged in one file and points are coloured regarding to the laser they belong to.
 
Maybe colour scanning is possible in the future.

Buildstage is very alpha yet, be warned!!

Inspired by the tutorial of cube000.
This is the initial commit.
